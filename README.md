## How I will continue to use Computer Science to learn as a student 
Computer science will help me learn as a student in many ways. The first manner is using computer science to help me learn how to think computationally. In other words, learning how to take a seemingly immense problem and breaking it down to little pieces. Also, the algortihmic thinking that I have learned will help tackle future projects, by helping me create an order of operations that I can use to complete a task. Computer science will also help me learn as a student by teaching me how to think visually, in the sense that I will be able to visualize my problems (such as math problems) to help me solve them. Finally, I will continue to use computer science to learn by implementing the skills that I used to debug programs in other fields. For exmaple, I can use skills such as looking at my answers from another (maybe more effective) perspective, in other courses like physics and chemistry. 

### A Summary of the Modules
#### Intro to JS
This module is what started off my journey into javascript. This was my favourite module because it helped solidify my skills that I learned while coding C++ programs in grade 11. Additionally, this is where I first started tackling object oriented design, which was incredibly interesting and useful for me. I found that it made a huge impact on my skill as a coder, and also gave me a whole new way to complete projects in a more simple fashion. Finally, learning how to use objects during this module helped me become more interested in leraning computer programming as it was easier to learn new things afterwards. 

#### Advanced JS: Games and Visualizations 
This was the next bit of javascript that I did. The biggest impact of this module was further extending my abilty to use objected oriented design to create programs. Specfically, I enjoyed learning how to use different objects together to create more complex things (where an object was greater than the sum of its parts). This was really shown in different game mechanics that I learned to program such as object collision. 

#### Advanced JS: Natural Simulations
This module was also very fun for me, but also the hardest. I found that this module took the longest time for me to do, and often I had to look back and solidify old knowledge before I was able to continue learning in this module. For this reason, the strongest impact of this course was its difficulty, because it was the difficulty that taught me how to learn. In otherwords, the difficulty taught me that it was better to take my time slowly and learning the basics properly so that I would not get frustrated when tackling more advanced objects.

#### AP Computer Science
I enjoyed this module a lot because it taught me the theory behind all of the computer programming that I was doing. I found that this helped me with my coding too, because I had a better understanding of how the comptuer understood my programs and then made an output. The biggest impact of this module was the fact that it explained to me how much of the world around as works. Too often do we take for granted all of the complex technology around us, and I feel that this module shed some light on this technology and helped me get a better understanding of how the "computer world" works. 

#### Intro to SQL
The biggeset impact of this module was learning how to manage data. Although the programs that I was creating did not have much of a use for SQL, I know it will defintley come in handy knowing the langauge for when I have to create bigger programs that handle large amounts of user input. For example, if I have to create a program that manages the output of other testing software, or other examples like this. 

#### Intro to HTML/CSS
I enjoyed learning HTML because learning how to develop webpages can help me in the future for creating things like a portfolio, like the one I am writing currently. The biggest impact of this module was learning how webpages load and how one can use CSS to make them look better. I think that learning HTML was a gateway to a different kind of programming (web programming) that I had not completley understood or fully engaged in beforehand. 

#### HTML/JS: Making Webpages Interactive
This HTML module was where I started to learn how to make webpages look more like the ones that I see around the internet. The biggest impact of this module was seeing how programmers make webpages react to user input, which frankly, is an integral part to almost every webpage that exists. This module was very important in furthering my understanding of HTML. 

#### HTML/JS: Making Webpages Interactive with JQuery
Out of the three HTML modules, this one taught me the most. The most impactful part of this module was learning how to use JQuery to simplify processes that I had been doing. After learning JQuery, I found that I was much more proficient at coding webpages. Furthermore, being introduced to the JQuery library helped me find other libraries that also made my coding life easier. 

#### Basic Javascript
This module on freecodecamp was very similar to the one that I have listed earlier. I found that freecodecamp went into more detail about the javascript, and really helped me nail down the fundamentals that I had learned. The most impactful part of this module was seeing the differences between how javascript was taught on khanacademy versus freecodecamp, and combining these differences so that I was coding in a manner that I found most comfortable and understandable to myself and others. 

#### Algorithms 
This was a very impactful module because it encouraged me to think a lot more before actually creating a program. For example, it forced me to learn how to make code that did not only "get the job done", but also did its task in the most efficient and effective manner. This kind of algorithmic thinking will really help me in other fields of studying, especially physics, where I found that the best answer was not only the right answer, but also the faster answer. 

### Cubing 
#### What One May Learn from Cubing 
The first thing that one learns from cubing is that it is okay to copy from those who came before you. When someone starts coding, it is easy to want to solve it without looking for algorithms online or seeking any kind of help. However, due to the nature of the puzzle, solving it like that would take an incredibly long time to do. Instead, it is better to look at the progress that others have made before you and learn from. You can then build on that progress yourself. The next thing that one learns from cubing is that seemingly complex puzzles can be solved with simple, ordered steps. In other words, cubing teaches you that the biggest problems can be broken down into small pieces and handled better in that manner. This is a lesson that can be applied anywhere in life, whether it is solving a hard math problem or trying to complete an essay. 

#### What I Learned from Cubing 
The biggest thing that I learned from cubing is to not be afraid to start tackling a complex problem. When I first started cubing and learning the algorithms needed to solve a cube, I was very hesitant to make turns and scramble the cube so that I could solve it again. This is because solving the cube took a lot of time for me in the beginning, and ruining the "perfect" cube that took so long for me to solve was distasteful. However, by getting over this hesitation, I became much better at solving the cube, and am no longer as scared tackling new problems because I am sure I can solve them if I stay focused. The next thing I learned from cubing is to value fundamentals. At the start of the semester, I started off trying to solve the pyraminx. I had learned the algorithms and was capable of solving it. However, if I ever made the wrong move, I was unable to fix it and continue solving the pyraminx. This is because I was not paying attention to what the algorithm was actually doing (cycling pieces). Once I realized what the algorithm was designed to do, solving the pyraminx became a lot more fluid. Ultimatley, this made learning the more complex puzzels like the 3x3 a lot easier. 



## Creative Refactorings 
I have refactored a couple things. The first is Dan Shiffman's smart rockets program. In this program, there is a barrier that stops rockets from reaching a location. By adding a "moveable barrier object", I created a barrier that moves left and right (within a certain range), therby creating a moveable barrier. The second thing that I refactored was a classmate's Tic-Tac-Toe game. To refactor this game, I took the draw function, which drew the grid and the X/Os that the players created, and created a seperate drawgrid function and a seperate drawX/O function. Afterwards, I used this to make it so that some of the placements became invisible. As a result, the players would have to keep track of where they placed their X or O's, therby turning tic-tac-toe into more of a memory game. The third creative refactoring I did was of a classmate's countdown timer. In the original code, the counter would countdown to a time, and after it reached the time, you would have to refresh the page to set a new countdown. To make it so that someone could add a new countdown timer without refreshing the page, I made it so that the program would start the timer every  time they clicked off the input box or hit enter. I did this by using a input.changed(createTimer) function.
